        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The perfect day starts with this delightful Eggs Benedict from none other than The Queen herself 
        from Shokugeki No Soma</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices thick-cut bacon</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 liter water</li>
            <li>100 ml vinegar</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>80 grams butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp of worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp of lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 english muffins</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Karasumi</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour water and vinegar into a pot and bring them to a boil, and then reduce the heat. 
            Stir the liquid with a spoon to create a small tornado/whirl, and then crack one egg into it directly, 
            and let it poach. After 2 minutes, scoop the egg out carefully with a slotted spoon and 
            immediately place it in cold water. Repeat until all eggs have been poached</li>
            <li>For the hollandaise sauce, place the egg yolks into a double boiler, and while they are warming, 
            mix them with a hand mixer and remove them once they reach room temperature</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a microwave and split them into 4 equal portions. Slowly add them to the mixture 
            and mix everything thoroughly. Add the worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and 
            mix well to finish off the sauce</li>
            <li>Cut the bacon slices into quarters and cook them in a frying pan until browned on both sides</li>
            <li>Slice the english muffins in half, toast them, and then spread with some butter and top them with the bacon slices</li>
            <li>Gently dry a poached egg and place on top of the bacon slices. Drizzle some hollandaise sauce on top and 
            top with some chopped parsley and grated karasumi. Place everything on a plate and decorate with a lettuce leaf on the side, and youâ€™re done!</li>
        </ol>

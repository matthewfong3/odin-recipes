        <p>FIRST PLACE BABY!!!!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 bowls cooked rice</li>
            <li>4 small salmon fillets</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 snap pea pods</li>
            <li>50ml Kabayaki sauce</li>
            <li>Salmon roe</li>
            <li>Roasted seaweed</li>
            <li>Grated daikon radish</li>
            <li>Spring onions</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Powdered Japanese pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Skin the salmon fillets. Setting the skin to the side, put the meat in the Kabayaki sauce to marinate. 
            (Cut square fillets in half lengthwise)</li>
            <li>Scrape off any excess meat and fat from the salmon skin. Sprinkle salt and sesame seeds on a sheet of aluminum foil 
            and place the salmon skin on top facedown. Sprinkle more salt and sesame seeds on the skin and then place in a toaster oven 
            and toast until the top is crispy. Flip the skin over and toast until thoroughly crispy. (Be sure to toast with the 
            outer skin facing up first or it will curl into a roll)</li>
            <li>Scramble the eggs and then cut into very thin sheets. Once cooled, julienne into thin strips. Strip the string off the snap pea pods 
            and lightly boil in salted water. Chill in cold water and then split on the seam. Dice the spring onions and mix a pinch with the 
            grated daikon radish. Cut the seaweed into strips</li>
            <li>Grill or pan fry the salmon fillets to the desired temperature. Brush on more Kabayaki sauce as desired</li>
            <li>Divide the cooked rice into two bowls. First, top each generously with the julienned egg strips. 
            Put a large dollop of the grated daikon radish with spring onions along the top edge of the bowl. 
            Place two salmon fillets below it and top them with more Kabayaki sauce (if desired) and sprinkle with Japanese pepper. 
            Lean a split pea pod, opened so the peas are visible, on the side of a fillet. Sprinkle the remainder of the julienned 
            egg strips over the top, and youâ€™re done!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hailing from Provence, a region in the south of France near the Mediterranean Sea, 
        ratatouille is a bright and chunky summer vegetable stew made with eggplant, zucchini, 
        bell peppers, and tomatoes. It is rich with the flavor of olive oil, garlic, and 
        fresh herbs.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large (1 1/4 lbs) eggplant, cut into 1/3-inch cubes</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2 medium zucchini (about 1 lb), cut into 1/3-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 red, orange or yellow bell pepper, cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
            <li>5 large cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>5 large vine-ripened tomatoes (1 3/4 lbs), cut into 1/3-inch cubes, with their juices</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh chopped thyme, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by heating 3 tablespoons of oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. 
            Add the eggplant and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring frequently, until soft and starting to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. 
            Transfer to a plate and set aside</li>
            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan (no need to clean it). Add the zucchini 
            and cook, stirring frequently, until tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and transfer to a plate; set aside</li>
            <li>Add two more tablespoons of oil to the pan and add the onion and bell pepper</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and continue cooking for about 3 minutes more. Do not brown. 
            Next, add the tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme, sugar, crushed red pepper flakes (if using) 
            and 3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are broken down into a sauce, 8 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the cooked eggplant to the pan; bring to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer, 
            uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until the eggplant is soft</li>
            <li>Add the zucchini and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more, or until just warmed through. 
            Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with fresh basil and thyme, drizzle with a little olive oil if desired, 
            and serve warm or chilled</li>
        </ol>
